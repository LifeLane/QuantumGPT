This is a NextJS starter app in Firebase Studio, transformed into Quantum GPT, an AI-powered cryptocurrency analysis and strategy tool.

To get started, explore the features:
- Dashboard: `/dashboard`
- AI Trading Strategy: `/strategy`
- Watchlist: `/watchlist`
- Price Alerts (Simulated): `/alerts`
- Charting Tools: `/charting`

The application uses Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, and Genkit for AI functionalities. It attempts to use the Messari API for live crypto data for AI features (requires a `COINDESK_API_KEY` environment variable set to your Messari key). TradingView widgets provide live data for charts and watchlists independently.
