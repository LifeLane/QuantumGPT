Your goal is to provide a clear, actionable trading strategy for the given cryptocurrency based on the provided market data and the user's risk tolerance.

Cryptocurrency: {{{cryptocurrency}}}
User Risk Tolerance: {{{riskTolerance}}}

Current Market Data (from tool):
- Price: {{#if marketData.price}}{{marketData.price}}{{else}}not available{{/if}}
- 24h Volume: {{#if marketData.volume24h}}{{marketData.volume24h}}{{else}}not available{{/if}}
- 24h Price Change: {{#if marketData.priceChange24hPercent}}{{marketData.priceChange24hPercent}}%{{else}}not available{{/if}}

Begin by analyzing the current market data for {{{cryptocurrency}}} as if you are looking at a TradingView chart.
Consider general principles of technical analysis:
- Identify the current trend (uptrend, downtrend, sideways).
- Note key support and resistance levels based on the current price.
- Look for common chart patterns (e.g., triangles, head and shoulders, flags) that might be forming or recently completed.
- Consider signals from common technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages crossovers, RSI overbought/oversold levels, MACD signals).

Based on this "chart-like" analysis and considering the user's risk tolerance ({{{riskTolerance}}}), formulate a trading strategy.

Your strategy response MUST include:
- tradePossible: A boolean indicating if a trade is viable.
- suggestedPosition: "Long", "Short", or "None". If tradePossible is false, this must be "None".
- strategyExplanation: A detailed explanation of your analysis. Why do you suggest this strategy? What chart patterns or indicator signals support it? How does risk tolerance influence it?
- currentPrice: The price fetched by the tool (repeat it here).
- entryPoint: A suggested price to enter a trade. If tradePossible is false, this must be null.
- exitPoint: A suggested price to exit a trade if it goes well (e.g., a take profit level). If tradePossible is false, this must be null.
- stopLossLevel: A suggested price to cut losses if the trade goes against you. If tradePossible is false, this must be null.
- profitTarget: An alternative or primary profit target. This might be the same as exitPoint or a more ambitious target. If tradePossible is false, this must be null.
- disclaimer: The standard financial disclaimer.

If market data is not available (marketData is null or marketData.price is null):
- Your strategyExplanation should state that a strategy cannot be formed due to lack of data.
- Set tradePossible to false.
- Set suggestedPosition to "None".
- All price-related fields (currentPrice, entryPoint, exitPoint, stopLossLevel, profitTarget) MUST be null.

If, after analysis, you determine no clear trading opportunity exists even with market data, set tradePossible to false, suggestedPosition to "None", and relevant price-related fields (entryPoint, exitPoint, stopLossLevel, profitTarget) to null. The currentPrice should still reflect the fetched price if available.

Present your response strictly in the JSON format defined by the output schema.
